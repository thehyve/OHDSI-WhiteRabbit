===========

Introduction
========
WhiteRabbit is a small application that can be used to analyse the structure and contents of a database as preparation for designing an ETL. It comes with RabbitInAHat, an application for interactive design of an ETL to the OMOP Common Data Model with the help of the the scan report generated by White Rabbit. 

Features
========
- Can scan databases in SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS Access, Amazon RedShift, and CSV files
- The scan report contains information on tables, fields, and frequency distributions of values
- Cutoff on the minimum frequency of values to protect patient privacy
- WhiteRabbit can be run with a graphical user interface or from the command prompt
- Interactive tool (Rabbit in a Hat) for designing the ETL using the scan report as basis
- Rabbit in a Hat generates ETL specification document according to OMOP template

Technology
============
White Rabbit and Rabbit in a Hat are pure Java applications. Both applications use [Apache's POI Java libraries](http://poi.apache.org/) to read and write Word and Excel files. White Rabbit uses JDBC to connect to the respective databases.

System Requirements
============
Requires Java 1.8 or higher, and read access to the database to be scanned. Java can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">http://www.java.com</a>.

Dependencies
============
For the distributable packages, the only requirement is Java 8. For building the package, also Maven is needed.
