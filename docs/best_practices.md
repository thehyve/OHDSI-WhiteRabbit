The following lists best practices in using WhiteRabbit and Rabbit-In-a-Hat to manage your ETL documentation process:

  * **Overall Process:**
    * When going through the ETL exercise, it is critical to get all key stakeholders in the room such as the data owners and individuals who plan to perform/manage research using the CDM. We have found different stakeholders have different perspectives on source data and the conversation that occurs improves the ETL process.
  * **WhiteRabbit:**
    * If it is known some tables will not be needed from the source data, do not include them in the scan. If there is a question to if the table is necessary it is better to include it.
  * **Rabbit-In-a-Hat:**
    * Start with mapping tables to tables and then dive into how one tableâ€™s fields map into CDM fields. In other words, stay at the table level until all tables a mapped, and then start to map fields.
    * If your source data does not contain certain information you do not need to impute or generate information to fulfil a CDM requirement. For example, if your source data does not contain an end date for when a medication was stopped you do not need to population the DRUG_EXPOSURE.DRUG_EXPOSURE_START_DATE column.
    * Derived CDM tables, like DRUG_ERA, typically will not receive a mapping from the source data because they are generated off the CDM table (in this case DRUG_ERA is generated off DRUG_EXPOSURE).
