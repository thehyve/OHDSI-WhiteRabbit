      <!-- Motivation: jackson-databind comes as a transitive dependency of apache avro, which is version locked due to Java 8 compatibility
           The CVE states that external access is needed for an exploit (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-35116),
           which is not possible according to the vendor, and in any case not an issue for the Rabbit tools, as these
           are assumed to be running in a safe environment
           PLEASE NOTE: this exclusion should be reassessed once apache avro is upgraded to a newer version than 1.11.4 -->
      <!-- exclude>com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind</exclude-->
